              In 2002, the seeds of Kapol Vidyanidhi International School were
              sown with a profound vision: to cultivate a realm of enlightenment
              through education. With a steadfast commitment to this noble
              cause, the management laid the foundation of the school,

              heart and soul.

              <br />
              Affiliated to the ICSE curriculum, the school embarked on its
              pioneering journey with a humble cohort of 69 students. Yet,
              fueled by a dedication to academic excellence and holistic
              education, the institution swiftly grew in prominence, earning
              accolades as one of the foremost educational institutions in the
              suburban landscape.

              We at Kapol love children and it was in 1982 that the Trustees started the
              first institute in Nalasopara called as Adarsh Education Society (SSC). In
              2002 <b>Kapol Vidyanidhi International School (ICSE)</b>&nbsp;came into existence and
              later came Kapol Vidyanidhi College of Hotel Management & Technology and
              Jiten Mody Junior College (HSC) of Arts, Commerce and Science. In a sense,
              today we nurture the 3 years old who come to us till they grow up into
              confident and responsible adults with a degree and skillsets to make their
              own path way in life. <br />
              <br />
              Few years back we dreamt of going one step further to prepare children for
              a global competitive world by starting an IGCSE School, affiliated to the
              Cambridge Board, UK.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our dream school, <b>Kapol Global Academy (IGCSE)</b>
              has embarked a journey of transformation, embracing
              new technologies, pedagogical approaches, and
              global perspectives to enrich the learning experience
              of our students. We are focusing on nurturing talent,
              fostering creativity and instilling a sense of responsibility
              and integrity in our students sets Cambridge School
              apart as a beacon of educational excellence.
              <br /><br />
              As we move ahead on a path illuminated by the
              transformative power of education, we seek
              your support to fulfill our noble endeavours.
